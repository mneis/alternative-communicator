## Normal procedure to start the project:
'''
npm run dev
'''

However, I had issues, and had to do some more procedures.

### Procedure that I had to run:

'''
npm install -g tsx
npm install express
npm run dev
'''

then, after start the server, we can access:

http://localhost:5001/

## BE AWARE!!!

From the main project, I had to change the port to 5001 instead 5000.

So, maybe to add to the replit.com again, we may need to change it to 5000 back.
